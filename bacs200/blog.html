       Immigration reform is a term that describes the potential changes to the law regarding immigrants and immigration. It is a term that is used by those who want to find a way for illegal immigrants to one day get permission to stay in the U.S. On the other hand, it has also been used by those who want to toughen immigration laws and reform the system to be less lenient.

        <p class="text-dark p-2 mt-4 mb-0 rounded">
    In March of 2003, the Department of Homeland Security presented the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, now known as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement of Ice. According to the Department of Homeland Security, the purpose of I.C.E. is to “protect America from the cross-border crime and illegal immigration that threatens national security and public safety.” <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Homeland-Security-Act">(Source)</a>
    </p>
    
    <p class="text-dark p-2 mt-4 mb-0 rounded">
    I.C.E was formed in direct response of the 9/11 attack and subsequent mailings of anthrax spores. The 2002 Homeland Security Act was signed into law by the former president George W. Bush and was co-sponsored by 118 members of the congress.

<p class="text-dark p-2 mt-4 mb-0 rounded"> 
    Recently, the media has been showing the abuse and mistreatment of immigrants in I.C.E detention centers. Americans have been questioning the unsanitary detention centers, lack of medical treatment, and lack of legal representation for immigrants. Now, the public is demanding answers and calls for reform. The most recent up rise was due to a whistleblower denouncing unethical hysterectomies of detainees. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/09/16/913398383/whistleblower-alleges-medical-neglect-questionable-hysterectomies-of-ice-detaine">(Source)</a> Protests across the country have revealed a divide in the country.

<h2 class=" border-light text-light bg-primary p-2 rounded font-weight-bold text-center text-info">Economic Implications</h2>
    <p class="text-dark p-2 mt-4 mb-0 rounded">
        The Administration states that immigrants are harmful to our nation and economy, but that is contradicted with varying reports. Immigrants work at high rates and are a part of some of the biggest industries in the U.S. According to the Economic Policy Institute, although immigrants fabricate about 13% of the population, they constitute 16% of the labor force.

    <p>Common misconceptions:
        <ul>
              <li>Immigrants work in only blue-collar jobs. False- “In the United States as a whole, there are almost as many immigrants in white-collar jobs (46 percent) as in all other occupations combined.” <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/immigration-facts/">(Source)</a> </li>
              <li>Immigrants take away jobs from American workers. False- Academic economists state that in the short run, immigration may slightly reduce the employment rates of native workers because it takes time for the economy to adjust to new immigration. Although that is the case, in the long run immigrants DO NOT reduce American employment rates.</li>
              <li>Immigrants do not pay taxes but reap the benefits of various programs. False- They contribute more to the system than they take out. Generally speaking, immigrants do not receive benefits from government programs, but they still pay sales tax, property tax, payroll and income taxes. </li>
        </ul>

    <h2 class=" border-light text-light bg-primary p-2 rounded font-weight-bold text-center text-info">Political Implications</h2>
    <p class="text-dark p-2 mt-4 mb-0 rounded">
        President Trump’s immigration plan for the 21st century calls for a fully secure border, expedite relief for legitimate asylum seekers and prevent fraudulent people from entering the country, and prioritizing the immediate families of U.S. citizens and new immigrants. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/president-trumps-bold-immigration-plan-21st-century/">(Source)</a> In hindsight, President Trump’s immigration reform does not appear to be  harmful, but his repeated damaging words against immigrants are prevalent. President Trump has said things such as Mexican immigrants are “drug dealers, criminals, and rapists,”  tried to implement a travel ban that prohibited issuing visas to 7 vastly Muslim countries (upheld by Supreme Court in 2018), wanting to end DACA, and imposing a zero tolerance policy which led to thousands of children being separated from their families.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_policy_of_Donald_Trump">(Source)</a>

            <p class="bg-light p-2 rounded">
               It is completely understandable to want to protect the American people, the American economy, and American pride. President Trump and the administration have curated a thorough immigration reform plan. Although that is true, the protection of the American people should not be at the expense of harming immigrants, disregarding their basic human and medical needs, and disregarding the psychological effects of the trauma they are facing. The statements said by President Trump and I.C.E officers promote xenophobia- point-blank period. For a country that was built on immigration, it is a shame we are treating real human lives with no care.
