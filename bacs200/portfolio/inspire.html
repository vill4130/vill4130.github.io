        Heroes are people that inspire us in myriad of ways.
        Whether they have changed the world or motivated us to change our own, they are people we look up to and emulate.
        
    </p>
    <p>
        The heroes that I most admire have the following characteristics:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> <strong>Unapologetically themselves - </strong>they don't let people dictate their lives and they do what is important.</li>
        <li> <strong>Motivate others - </strong> they motivate others to do what is right.</li>
        <li> <strong>Huge Impact - </strong> they change the lives of millions around the world.</li>
        <li> <strong>Sacrifice & commitment - </strong>their actions may lead people to dislike them, but they still act on what is beneficial for others.</li>
        <li> <strong>Integrity -</strong> they stay true to their calling.</li>
    </ul>

        AOC is a true icon of our generation. I look up to her for various reasons.
        At the age of 29, she is the youngest woman <em>ever</em> to serve in the United States Congress.
        AOC was previously an activist and she now advocates a progressive platform.
        Despite being constantly discredited by some of her counterparts, she never fails to fight for what is right.</p>
    <p>
        A real life heroine, AOC motivates me and various others. <strong>She is my hero.</strong>
